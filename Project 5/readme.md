## Dataset

The sinking of Titanic is one of the most notorius shipwrecks in the history. In 1912, during her voyage, Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.The titanic data frames describe the survival status of individual passengers on the Titanic. The titanic data frame does not contain information from the crew, but it does contain actual ages of half of the passengers. The principal source for data about Titanic passengers is the Encyclopedia Titanica. The datasets used here were begun bya variety of researchers. One of the original sources is Eaton & Haas (1994) Titanic: Triumph and Tragedy, Patrick Stephens Ltd, which includes a passenger list created by many researchers and edited by Michael A. Findlay
